# Index of Digitized Armenian Manuscripts

Access to website [https://www.armenian-manuscripts-index.com](https://www.armenian-manuscripts-index.com)

The Index of Armenian Manuscripts lists Armenian manuscripts digitized and available in full access in digital libraries. It compiles the main metadata available in the catalogs (dimensions, support, title, number of pages, copy date) and offers direct access to the document. Most of the manuscripts are available via IIIF, and are therefore viewable with the Mirador viewer. They can also be directly annotated and transcribed with the [Calfa Vision platform](https://vision.calfa.fr).
Access to certain resources may require the creation of an account on the digital library.

Original list has been established by [Association Internationale des Études Arméniennes](https://sites.uclouvain.be/aiea/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/AIEA_Newsletter_54-compressed.pdf) and by Anush Sargsyan in 2018, and has been expanded by [Calfa](https://calfa.fr) team (2018 -).

ID column follows [guidelines designed by Bernard Coulie](https://sites.uclouvain.be/aiea/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/10_List-of-acronyms.pdf) to identify Armenian manuscripts in the main worldwide collections.

## Methodology

This index only compiles metadata provided by online and, if necessary, paper catalogs, in their original language. It does not include standardization or traduction of names yet (WIP). The index is mainly focused on historical manuscripts (prior to the 20th century), but may sometimes include some modern handwritten archives.
